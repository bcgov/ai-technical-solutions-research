        <p>
          In BC Gov, compute means enabling diverse models and applications across on-prem and public cloud hardware.
          Most current research focuses on measuring on-prem CPU and GPU performance.

        <h3>AI Internals</h3>
        <p>
          Models and tooling change quickly at the surface. Deeper understanding of model behavior and failure patterns
          helps us build AI with our own architecture choices and datasets over time, including safer dataset
          preparation and training methods.

        <h3>Applications and Agentic Systems</h3>
        <p>
          We study agentic systems, tool orchestration, and human-in-the-loop controls so workflows are reliable in
          production, not just in demos.

        <h3>Safe AI and Red Teaming</h3>
        <p>
          Threat tests, red teaming, eval suites, and rollout safeguards are treated as core engineering requirements
          for public-sector use.

        <h3>How depth helps BC Gov services</h3>
        <p>
          A depth-first approach improves reliability, safety, and cost control for services that must operate at
          public-sector standards.
        </p>
        <ul class="depth-side-list">
          <li>Better model and infrastructure choices before scale-up.</li>
          <li>Fewer rollout surprises through stronger failure analysis.</li>
